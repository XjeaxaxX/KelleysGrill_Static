					This lamp was made for a 50th wedding anniversary.  
					Made for a lake house, it incorporates hardware from an old pontoon boat that the couple had.
					It rests on a blue piece of wood cut in waves, representing the lake.  
					Angled up from that is the main boat-shaped platform for the lamp.
					The main on/off switch is the keyed ignition switch.  
					However, much like a boat, it will not do anything unless you have it in gear.  So the gear selector also acts as a secondary on/off switch.
					The throttle acts as a dimmer.  The running lights switch activates underlighting.  
					An included remote control allows for various color selections of the underlighting.
					A 1970 penny symbolizes the year the couple were married.
